## What Is A Queue?

- It is a linear data structure used for storing data.
- It's an ordered list in which insertion is done at one end, called "rear", and
  deletion is done at the other end (the beginning), called "front".
- The first element inserted is the first one to be deleted. hence, it is
  called as a "First In First Out" (FIFO) list.

```
front                                      rear
  |                                          |
[10, ] --> [8, ] --> [1, ] --> [11, ] --> [15, ] --> null
```

NOTE: Essentially, it's akin to a line of people. "I arrived first, I get helped
first."
