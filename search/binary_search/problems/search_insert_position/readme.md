## Problem Statement

Q. Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the
index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it
were inserted in order. The algorithm should run in O(log n) time.

Example:

- Input arr = {1, 3, 5, 7}, target = 5
- Output: 2
- Input arr = {1, 3, 5, 7}, target = 2
- Output: 1
- Input arr = {1, 3, 5, 7}, target = 8
- Output:4
- Input arr = {1, 3, 5, 7}, target = 0
- Output: 0
