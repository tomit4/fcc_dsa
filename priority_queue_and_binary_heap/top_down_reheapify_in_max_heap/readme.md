## Top-down Reheapify Max Heap

- After deleting an element from the maxp heap, it may not satisfy the max heap
  properties. Thusly, we perform a top-down reheapify technique (otherwise known
  as a "sink"), in which we adjust the locations of the elements to satisfy the
  max heap properties.

  NOTE: See slides.
