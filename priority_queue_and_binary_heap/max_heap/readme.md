## Max Binary Heap

- A Max heap is a complete binary tree in which each node value is >= the values
  of its children.
- The maximum value is at the top which is root of a complete binary tree. For
  its array representation, it's at index 1 (i.e. heap[1]).

```
--------MAX HEAP-------
all values are >= the values of its children
          (9)
          / \
      (3)     (6)
      / \     / \
    (2) (1) (5) (4)
--------MAX HEAP AS ARRAY-------
[null, 9, 3, 6, 2, 1, 5, 4]
        heap[]

```
