## Introduction To Dynamic Programming

Dynamic Programming is a technique in which a complex problem is solved in the
following methods:

1. Breaking the problem down into smaller sub-problems.
2. Sovling those sub-problems and then simply storing the results.
3. Re-using those stored results <em>if</em> the sub-problems occurs/overlaps again.
   (Avoid solving sub-problem again).
4. Finally, utilizing solutions to smaller problems to build up a solution to
   more a complex problem.
