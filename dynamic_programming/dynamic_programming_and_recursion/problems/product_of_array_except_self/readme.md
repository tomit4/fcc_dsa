## Problem Statement

Q. Given an array of integers `arr[]`, return an array `result[]` such that
`result[i]` is equal to the product of all the elements of `arr` except `arr[i]`.
The product fits in a 32-bit integer. The algorithm should run in O(n) time and
without using the division operator.

Example -
Input: arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]
Output: result = [24, 12, 8, 6]

Input: arr = [-1, 1, 0, -3, 3]
Output: result = [0, 0, 9, 0, 0]
