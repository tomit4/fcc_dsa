## What Is Hashing?

- Hashing is a technique used for storing, retrieving and removing information
  as quickly as possible.
- It's a process of converting an arbitrary size key into a fixed size value.
  The conversion is done via a special function known as a Hash function.
- The operations supported by hashing such as storing, retrieving, and removing
  information have an average runtime complexity of O(1).
