## Insertion Sort

- Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works the way we sort playing
  cards in our hands.
- In Insertion sort we divide the given array into two parts - the sorted part and the
  unsorted part.
- From the unsorted part, we take the first element and place it at its
  correct position in a sorted array. This is done by shifting all the elements
  which are larger than the first element by one position.
- This is repeated until the unsorted array is not empty.
