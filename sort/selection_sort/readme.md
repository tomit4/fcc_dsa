## Selection Sort

- In Selection sort we divide the given array into two parts - the sorted part and
  unsorted part.
- The algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum in an unsorted
  array and making it part of the sorted array.
- From the unsorted part, we pick the minimum element and swap it with the
  leftmost element of the unsorted part. After the swap, that element now becomes
  part of the sorted array.
- This is repeated until the unsorted array is not empty.
