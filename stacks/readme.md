## What Is A Stack?

- It is a linear data structure used for storing data.
- It's an ordered list in which insertion and deletion are done at one end,
  called "top".
- The last element inserted is the first one to be deleted. Hence, it is called
  as a "Last In First Out" (aka LIFO) list.

[10, ] --> [8, ] --> [1, ] --> [11, ] --> [15, ] --> null
```
